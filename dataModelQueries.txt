—-	1	How many students are enrolled in a course on a specific day?
SELECT count(*) 
FROM Enrollments e 
JOIN AddDropWithdrawal adw ON e.enrollment_id = adw.enrollment_id 
WHERE date < '2020-10-15' AND course_id = 49 AND action_type = 'A';

-- note: I would then need to minus the count of 'W' and 'D' from this count

—-	2	How many grades does a given instructor need to turn in?
select count(*) 
from Grades g 
join Enrollments e on g.enrollment_id = e.enrollment_id 
join Courses c on e.course_id = c.course_id 
join Instructor I on c.instructor_id = I.instructor_id 
where first_name = 'Taylor' and last_name = 'Barnes';

—-	3	What is the GPA of an individual student for a given semester?
SELECT SUM(g.gpa_equivalent * e.credit_hours) / SUM(e.credit_hours)
FROM Grades g
JOIN Enrollments e ON g.enrollment_id = e.enrollment_id
JOIN Courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
JOIN Student s ON e.student_id = s.studentId
WHERE s.first_name = 'Robert' AND s.last_name = 'Baker' AND c.semester = 'Fall';

—-	4	What is the cumulative GPA of an individual student?
SELECT SUM(g.gpa_equivalent * e.credit_hours) / SUM(e.credit_hours)
FROM Grades g
JOIN Enrollments e ON g.enrollment_id = e.enrollment_id
JOIN Courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
JOIN Student s ON e.student_id = s.studentId
WHERE s.first_name = 'Robert' AND s.last_name = 'Baker';

-- 	5	How many students passed their courses each semester?
SELECT c.semester, COUNT(*)
FROM Grades g
JOIN Enrollments e ON g.enrollment_id = e.enrollment_id
JOIN Courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
WHERE g.passing = 'True'
GROUP BY c.semester;

-- note: g.passing was imported as a string instead of a boolean

--	6	How does daily enrollment activity during last semester’s open enrollment period compare to the same period the year prior?
SELECT TO_CHAR(adw.date, '2020-10-15'), COUNT(*)
FROM AddDropWithdrawal adw
JOIN Enrollments e ON adw.enrollment_id = e.enrollment_id
JOIN Courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
WHERE c.semester = 'Winter'
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(adw.date, '2020-10-15')
UNION
SELECT TO_CHAR(adw.date, '2021-10-15'), COUNT(*)
FROM EddDropWithdrawal adw
JOIN Courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
WHERE c.semester = 'Winter'
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(e.date, '2021-10-15');
